## Section 1: Description of the data.

The dataset I’m using measures how Americans consume and order their steak–along with questions on their thoughts and past behavior. It was collected through surveymonkey, approximately in 2014,  and in a fixed-width csv format. 

The research questions I’m interested in is to understand the relationship between people who eat steak and their demographic background.

There are 551 observations (including top row) in the dataset and 15 variables total (including 1 variable on auto-generated respondent ID). Each row contains responses from 1 user and each column contains their response on specific questions.

## Section 2: reading the data into R.
``` {r, echo = TRUE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv"
steak_survey <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/steak-survey/steak-risk-survey.csv")

```
## Section 3: Clean the data. 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
##Filtering the demographic data.
steak_survey_demographic <- steak_survey %>% 
  select((ncol(steak_survey)-4):ncol(steak_survey))

##Filtering the people who eat steak
names(steak_survey)
steak_yes <- steak_survey %>%
  filter(`Do.you.eat.steak.` == 'Yes')

##Transforming qualitative values to numerical values
steak_survey <- steak_survey %>%
  mutate(`Do.you.eat.steak.` = case_when(
    `Do.you.eat.steak.` == "Yes" ~ 1,
    `Do.you.eat.steak.` == "No" ~ 0,
  ))

steak_survey <- steak_survey %>%
  filter(!is.na(`How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.`)) %>%
  mutate(`How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` = case_when(
    `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` == "Rare" ~ 1,
    `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` == "Medium rare" ~ 2,
    `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` == "Medium" ~ 3,
    `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` == "Medium well" ~ 4,
    `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.` == "Well" ~ 5,
    TRUE ~ NA_integer_
  ))


steak_survey <- steak_survey %>%
  filter(!is.na(Gender)) %>%
  mutate(Gender = case_when(
    Gender == "Male" ~ 0L,
    Gender == "Female" ~ 1L,
    TRUE ~ NA_integer_
  ))
```

This dataset has `r nrow(steak_survey)` rows and `r ncol(steak_survey)` columns. The names of the columns and a brief description of each are in the table below:

## Section 4: Characteristics of the data.
```{r, echo=TRUE}

tldr <- summary(steak_survey)
tldr

rowtotal <- nrow(steak_survey)
coltotal <- ncol(steak_survey)

coltable <- data.frame( 
  `Column Number` = 1:4,
  `Column Name` = c("Do.you.eat.steak.", "Household.Income", "Age", "Location..Census.Region."),
  `Description` = c("If respondent eat steak",
                    "The respondent's income",
                    "Age of the respondent",
                    "Location of the respondent")
)
coltable

kable(coltable, caption = "Steak consumption and demographic data")
```
## Section 5: Subset and Summary

```{r summary-section, echo=TRUE}

#Picking 3 columns
three_col <- select(steak_survey, `Do.you.eat.steak.`, `How.do.you.like.your.steak.prepared.`, Gender)


#Getting summary of the subset of the data
    
summarytable<-summary(three_col)
print(summarytable)
```
